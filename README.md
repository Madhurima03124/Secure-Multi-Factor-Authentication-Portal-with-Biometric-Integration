# Secure-Multi-Factor-Authentication-Portal-with-Biometric-Integration
A sophisticated full-stack authentication module for high security websites.

# Comprehensive Authentication Platform 🔐

A secure and efficient authentication platform built using **Python**, **Flask**, and **MongoDB**, featuring **multi-factor authentication** (MFA), **facial recognition** with **OpenCV** and **TensorFlow**, and a secure **email OTP system** with **SMTProtocol** for enhanced security. 🚀

## Features 🌟

- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Provides a second layer of security using **Flask** for the backend and **HTML/CSS** for the frontend. 🔒
- **Facial Recognition**: Utilizes **OpenCV** and **TensorFlow** to verify user identity with a high degree of accuracy. 🧠👁️
- **Secure Email OTP**: Sends one-time passwords (OTPs) via **SMTProtocol** and implements **rate limiting** to protect against brute force attacks. 📧🔑

## Technologies Used 🛠️
